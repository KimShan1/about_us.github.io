    <h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>

    <p>
        I’m Shanti — a Data Scientist with a Master of Business Analytics from MIT Sloan and a passion for building AI-driven systems that solve real-world problems. I combine machine learning, causal inference, optimization, and modern LLM workflows to generate insights, improve decisions, and create scalable data products.
    </p>

    <p>
        I recently worked as a <strong>Senior Data Analyst (Data Scientist) at Cirkul</strong>, where I built LLM-powered automation tools for CX and Marketing using <strong>OpenAI, Agents Workflow, ChatKit, LangChain, and Apify</strong>, enabling insights from 20K+ weekly social posts to surface churn drivers and accelerate creative learning. 

        I led <strong>Marketing Mix Modeling (Robyn / Meridian)</strong> and DMA-level <strong>GeoLift causal lift experiments</strong> to reallocate multi-million-dollar budgets toward higher-ROAS channels. I also drove key <strong>funnel performance improvements</strong> by analyzing Amazon/DTC behavior across <strong>nCPA, subscription health, retention, new vs. repeat customer patterns, and drop-off points</strong> across the purchase journey.

        I frequently collaborated with Data Engineering to enhance <strong>ETL pipelines, dbt-style modeling (Paradime), AWS data infrastructure, and data quality processes</strong>, ensuring reliable analytics for product, marketing, CX, logistics, and retail teams.

    </p>

    <p>
        My background spans machine learning, deep learning, LLM systems, forecasting, experimentation, and optimization — grounded in strong mathematical and statistical foundations. Before Cirkul, I worked in <strong>retail analytics, ride-hailing operations (DiDi)</strong>, and <strong>equity research (Morgan Stanley)</strong>, developing forecasting models, marketplace strategies, A/B tests, and financial analyses.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m passionate about</h2>

    <p>
        I love exploring new ideas across AI, mathematics, physics, and complex systems. I read at least one <strong>academic paper per week</strong> (machine learning, optimization, or LLMs) and I review a different <strong>ML / DL / LLM Theory / Causal Inference</strong> topic every day — with a focus on intuition, mathematical rigor, and real-world application.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also enjoy studying the foundations of <strong>quantum mechanics, linear algebra, real analysis, optimization theory, and probability</strong> as part of my long-term goal of bridging theoretical math with applied AI systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Industry Experience</h2>

    <button class="collapsible">Marketing, Retail & E-Commerce <span class="icon">+</span></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            At Cirkul and during MIT’s Operations Research projects, I built causal inference pipelines (GeoLift, DiD), Marketing Mix Models (Robyn/Meridian), and forecasting tools for promotion strategy and subscription health. I designed dashboards, optimized funnels, and helped drive budget allocation across Amazon, DTC, and paid channels.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Ride-Hailing (DiDi) <span class="icon">+</span></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            I optimized marketplace operations using geospatial analytics, SQL, Python, cohort analysis, A/B testing, and incentive modeling — increasing trip growth and improving supply ROI.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Finance & Markets <span class="icon">+</span></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            At Morgan Stanley, I built valuation models, market forecasts, and fundamental analyses. I’ve also developed fraud-detection algorithms (including smart-contract security) and sentiment-driven financial models using NLP and LLM techniques.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Construction & Industrial <span class="icon">+</span></button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            For Doosan Bobcat (MIT Capstone), I built an LLM-powered multi-agent system to extract insights across YouTube, Reddit, and the web — using Autogen, Apify, OpenAI, and advanced NLP to generate competitive intelligence and product strategy insights.
        </p>
    </div>
        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>

<button class="collapsible">Learning Languages <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        I’m passionate about languages and cross-cultural communication. I speak <strong>Spanish, English, Korean, and Japanese</strong>, and I’m fascinated by how language shapes thought, perception, and problem-solving. Learning new languages constantly challenges my memory, pattern recognition, and adaptability — qualities that also strengthen my work as a data scientist.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Music <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        Music is one of my favorite creative outlets. I play the <strong>guitar, ukulele, and piano</strong>, and I love exploring Jazz, Classical, and modern Alternative. Music helps me think more clearly — it enhances structured thinking, rhythmical intuition, and the ability to recognize complex patterns, all of which naturally translate into analytical work.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Chess & Strategy Games <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        I love <strong>chess</strong> and board games because they sharpen strategic thinking, probabilistic reasoning, and long-term planning. Some favorites are Wingspan, Twilight Struggle, CATAN, 7 Wonders, and Small World. These games help me train the same cognitive muscles I use in modeling: anticipating outcomes, optimizing decisions, and thinking several steps ahead.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Reading <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        I’m an avid reader across <strong>philosophy, science, mathematics, literature, psychology, and music</strong>. I love exploring complex ideas and understanding the world through different lenses. Reading helps me stay intellectually curious and continuously deepens my analytical intuition. My current books include <em>Lying</em> (Sam Harris) and <em>The Book of Why</em> (Judea Pearl).
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Art & Creativity <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        I enjoy <strong>painting and drawing</strong> as a way to express creativity and refine attention to detail. Visual art teaches me to approach problems from different angles, pay attention to subtle patterns, and think beyond rigid structures — all valuable skills in data science and modeling.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Video Games <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        I love video games for their blend of storytelling, design, music, and strategic decision-making. Titles like Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, It Takes Two, and Lies of P inspire me with their creativity and challenge my perseverance. They also reflect my interest in how systems, mechanics, and incentives interact — which mirrors how I think about models and data.
    </p>
</div>

<button class="collapsible">Roller Skating <span class="icon">+</span></button>
<div class="content">
    <p>
        I’ve been roller skating since I was 8. It gives me a sense of freedom, rhythm, and flow — and is one of my favorite ways to stay active and disconnect mentally. It balances the analytical demands of my work with something joyful and physical.
    </p>
