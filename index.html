    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
        I’m Shanti, a Data Scientist with a Master of Business Analytics from MIT Sloan and a passion for building AI-driven systems that solve real-world problems. I combine machine learning, causal inference, optimization, and modern LLM workflows to generate insights, improve decisions, and create scalable data products.
    </p>

    <p>
        I recently worked as a <strong>Senior Data Analyst (Data Scientist) at Cirkul</strong>, where I built LLM-powered automation tools for CX and Marketing using <strong>OpenAI, Agents Workflow, ChatKit, LangChain, and Apify</strong>, enabling insights from 20K+ weekly social posts to surface churn drivers and accelerate creative learning. 

        I led <strong>Marketing Mix Modeling (Robyn / Meridian)</strong> and DMA-level <strong>GeoLift causal lift experiments</strong> to reallocate multi-million-dollar budgets toward higher-ROAS channels. I also drove key <strong>funnel performance improvements</strong> by analyzing Amazon/DTC behavior across <strong>nCPA, subscription health, retention, new vs. repeat customer patterns, and drop-off points</strong> across the purchase journey.

        I frequently collaborated with Data Engineering to enhance <strong>ETL pipelines, dbt-style modeling (Paradime), AWS data infrastructure, and data quality processes</strong>, ensuring reliable analytics for product, marketing, CX, logistics, and retail teams.

    </p>

    <p>
        My background spans machine learning, deep learning, LLM systems, forecasting, experimentation, and optimization grounded in strong mathematical and statistical foundations. Before Cirkul, I worked in <strong> ride-hailing operations (DiDi)</strong  and <strong>equity research (Morgan Stanley)</strong>, developing forecasting models, marketplace strategies, A/B tests and financial valuations and models.
    </p>

    <h2>What I’m passionate about</h2>

    <p>
        I love learning and exploring new ideas across AI, mathematics, physics and complex systems. I read at least one <strong>academic paper per week</strong> and I review a different <strong> ML / DL / LLM Theory / Causal Inference</strong> topic every day  with a focus on intuition, mathematical rigor and real-world application.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also enjoy studying the foundations of <strong>quantum mechanics, linear algebra, real analysis, optimization theory, and probability</strong> as part of my long-term goal of bridging theoretical math with applied AI systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Industry Experience</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            At Cirkul and during MIT’s Operations Research projects, I built causal inference pipelines (GeoLift, DiD), Marketing Mix Models (Robyn/Meridian) and forecasting tools for promotion strategy and subscription health. I designed dashboards, optimized funnels, and helped drive budget allocation across Amazon, DTC and paid channels.
