# Hello! 

I'm Marian (Shanti) a Data Scientist trained at MIT Sloan and the Operations Research Center, with experience building LLM systems, causal inference pipelines and marketing analytics solutions. I previously worked at Cirkul as a Senior Data Analyst/Data Scientist, where I built agentic LLM workflows, led MMM (Robyn/Meridian) and GeoLift experiments, and developed dashboards and data products that improved decision-making across Marketing, CX, Product and Operations.

My background spans optimization, machine learning, deep learning, LLM finetuning, embeddings, RAG, NLP, experimentation and data engineering collaboration. I enjoy turning complex problems into scalable, production-ready analytical workflows.

Interests: Optimization, ML/DL, LLMs, Causal Inference, RAG systems, Agentic AI, Business & Marketing Analytics, and applied data science that drives measurable business value.
