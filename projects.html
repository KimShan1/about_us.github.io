            <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <p>I'm passionate about applying data science to solve real-world problems. I believe data analysis is a powerful tool, and I'm always seeking opportunities to learn and grow. Projects on personal intriguing topics fuel my curiosity and allow me to experiment with new techniques. I'm always curious to explore new areas and tackle interesting challenges with data analysis. Dive into my projects to see how I leverage data analytics.

                         Description: The objective of this project was to predict whether an ether transaction is fraudulent and whether a smart contract is not safe. This project was a team project (of 2) for the Machine Learning Under an Optimization Lens course at MIT. A CNN was implemented for the smart contracts and an Optimal Classification Tree(OCT) for the Ether Transactional Data.
